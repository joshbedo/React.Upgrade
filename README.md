# React.Upgrade
Upgrade your React app from 0.10.x to 0.12.x


# Usage
1. $ git clone the project where you javascript files live
2. $ cd React.Upgrade && chmod +x upgrade.py
3. If possible remove all of your vendor scripts in your project as these will only generate more noise for you to sort through during your upgrade process.

4. $ ./upgrade.py PATH_TO_PROJECT_DIR

NOTE: sometimes you have to change the permissions on the `upgrade.py` you can do this by executing `chmod +x upgrade.py`
